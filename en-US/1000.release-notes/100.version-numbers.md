# Versioning rules

This topic describes the versioning rules of OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).

The features of ODP can vary significantly based on the version. Therefore, you must confirm the required ODP version to obtain the correct document information.

The version number of ODP is in the V.x.y.z format.

* `x` indicates a major version, which generally involves an architectural upgrade or a release of major features.

* `y` indicates a planned iteration version, which involves an update or optimization of major features in a normal iteration plan.

* `z` indicates an updated version, which involves a few updates in features and fixes known issues.

## View the version

After ODP is installed, check the version of ODP in the following ways:

1. View the directory of ODP. The directory of ODP of the new version contains the version number. For example, the obproxy-4.0.0 directory indicates ODP version 4.0.0.

2. Run the `./bin/obproxy -V` command in the home directory of ODP to view its version. Take ODP V3.2.3 as an example:

   ```shell
   [admin@test obproxy]# ./bin/obproxy -V
   ./bin/obproxy -V
   obproxy (OceanBase 3.2.32)
   REVISION: 6-local-99faebfc7130b70ad0f56330a28cab6a32ec9a33
   BUILD_TIME: Mar 30 2022 01:53:08
   ```

3. Log on to ODP by using the root@proxysys account and then run the `show proxyinfo binary` command to view the ODP version. Take version 4.0.0 as an example.

   ```sql
   MySQL [(none)]> show proxyinfo binary\G
