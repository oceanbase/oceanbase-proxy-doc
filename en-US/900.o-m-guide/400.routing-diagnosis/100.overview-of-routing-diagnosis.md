# Overview

This topic introduces the background information and the process of the routing diagnostics feature.

## Background information

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) is the access layer and routing layer of OceanBase Database, and routing is the core feature of ODP. In earlier versions, it is difficult to troubleshoot routing issues. Therefore, ODP V4.2.1 introduces the routing diagnostics feature, in which several diagnostic points are set during the SQL routing process in order to record critical status information. These diagnostic points are then output to logs or command lines. By analyzing the output diagnostic points, it is possible to understand clearly what happened during the process from a SQL statement entering ODP to being forwarded.

## Process

The process of the routing diagnostics feature is as follows:

1. Obtain diagnostic information. For details about how to obtain diagnostic information, see [Obtain diagnostic information](200.obtaining-diagnostic-information.md).

2. Troubleshoot issues based on the diagnostic information. For more information, see [Overview](300.diagnosis-point-troubleshooting/100.overview-of-diagnosis-point-troubleshooting.md).
