# Overview

This topic describes the background of the routing diagnostics feature, how to obtain diagnostic information, and how to locate and solve issues based on diagnostic information.

## Background information

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) serves as the access and routing layers of OceanBase Database and routing is its core feature. In earlier versions, routing issues are difficult to troubleshoot. Therefore, ODP V4.2.1 provides the routing diagnostics feature. This feature allows you to set diagnostic points during the routing process of an SQL statement in ODP to record key status information. The diagnostic points are then returned in logs or the result set. You can analyze the diagnostic points to learn about the routing process of an SQL statement in ODP.

## Routing diagnostics procedure

To use the routing diagnostics feature for troubleshooting, perform the following steps:

1. Obtain diagnostic information. For more information, see [Obtain diagnostic information](200.obtaining-diagnostic-information.md).

2. Perform troubleshooting based on the diagnostic information. For more information, see [Overview](300.diagnosis-point-troubleshooting/100.overview-of-diagnosis-point-troubleshooting.md).
