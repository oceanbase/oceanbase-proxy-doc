* retry_status: the retry status. Valid values:

  * FOUND_EXISTING_ADDR: An available address is found.

  * NOT_FOUND_EXISTING_ADDR: No address is available for a retry.

  * NO_NEED_RETRY: No retry is needed.

* retry_type: the retry type, indicating where the retry address comes from. Valid values:
