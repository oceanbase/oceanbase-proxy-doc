# Overview

This topic describes how to troubleshoot issues based on diagnostic points.

## Troubleshooting procedure

After obtaining diagnostic information, you can perform different troubleshooting operations based on whether the routed request is in a transaction.

### Request is in a transaction

If a request in a transaction is inaccurately routed, the following two cases are involved:

* Regular transaction

   In a regular transaction, the current request is routed together with the first statement in the transaction. In this case, extract the SQL statement in [Trx 1st SQL], pass the statement to the `explain route` command to run the command again, and then check the diagnostic points based on the diagnostic procedure.

* Distributed transaction

  * If the current request is inaccurately routed, check the diagnostic points based on the diagnostic procedure.

  * If the current request is routed to the coordinator node, extract the SQL statement in [Trx 1st SQL], pass the statement to the `explain route` command to run the command again, and then check the diagnostic points based on the diagnostic procedure.

### Request is not in a transaction

If an inaccurately routed request is not in a transaction, you can directly check the diagnostic points based on the diagnostic procedure.

## Diagnostic procedure

After obtaining diagnostic information by running the `explain route` command or from diagnostic logs, you can check the diagnostic points one by one according to the following procedure. For details about the variables to diagnose at each diagnostic point, see the documentation later in this chapter.
