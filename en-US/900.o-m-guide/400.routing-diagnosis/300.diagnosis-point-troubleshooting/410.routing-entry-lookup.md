# ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP

This topic describes the ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point.

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) cannot perform routing only based on the name of a stored procedure. It needs to obtain the first statement in the stored procedure and use it as the basis for routing calculation. The ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point records the first statement in a stored procedure. The following figure shows the diagnostic information at this diagnostic point.

The following are variables to diagnose at the ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point:

* routine_sql: the first SQL statement in the stored procedure. If this statement is inconsistent with the expected result, the partition information cannot be correctly parsed, which may lead to inaccurate routing.

* from_remote: The value `true` indicates that the information is directly returned from an OBServer node. If the information is not returned from an OBServer node, it is possible that the information has been modified on the OBServer node but the latest information is not synchronized to ODP, which may cause remote routing.

* is_lookup_succ: indicates whether the query is successful. The value `false` indicates that the query fails and the first statement in the stored procedure cannot be obtained. In this case, routing is performed according to the routing strategy.

* entry_state: the state of cached data of the stored procedure. The value `DIRTY` may result in inaccurate routing. Valid values:

  * BORN: Cache information is just created and no data is available.

  * BUILDING: Cache information is being built.

  * AVAIL: Cache information is available.

  * DIRTY: Cache information has expired, which may result in dirty data.

  * UPDATING: Cache information is being updated.

  * DELETED: Cache information has been deleted or removed. The value `DELETED` indicates that the cache information is unavailable.

If there are no issues with this diagnostic point, you can continue to check the TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point. For detailed information, see [TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP](420.table-entry-lookup.md).
