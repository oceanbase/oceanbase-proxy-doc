# ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE

This topic describes the ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point.

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) cannot perform routing just based on the function name of a stored procedure. It needs to obtain the first statement in the stored procedure and perform routing calculation based on the first statement. The ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point records the content of a stored procedure. The following table describes the diagnostic information at the ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point.

| Field | Description | Remarks |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| routine_sql | The first SQL statement in a stored procedure. | If the statement does not meet the expectation, the partition information cannot be correctly parsed, which thereby results in inaccurate routing.  |
| entry_from_remote | Indicates whether information is returned from an OBServer node in real time. | The value `true` indicates that the information is directly returned from an OBServer node. If the information is not returned from an OBServer node, it is possible that the information has been modified on OBServer nodes but the latest information is not synchronized to ODP, thereby resulting in remote routing.  |
| is_lookup_succ | Indicates whether the query is successful. | The value `false` indicates that the query failed and the first statement in the stored procedure cannot be obtained. In this case, routing is performed based on the routing strategy.  |
| entry_state | The data caching status. |  The value `DIRTY` may result in inaccurate routing. Valid values: <ul><li>BORN: Cache information is just created and no data is available. </li><li>BUILDING: Cache information is being built. </li><li>AVAIL: Cache information is available. </li><li>DIRTY: Cache information has expired, which will result in dirty data. </li><li>UPDATING: Cache information is being updated. </li><li>DELETED: Cache information has been deleted or removed. The value `DELETED` indicates that the cache information is unavailable. </li></ul> |
