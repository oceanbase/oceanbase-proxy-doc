# CONGESTION_CONTROL

This topic describes the CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point.

The CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point is used to query whether the OBServer node to be connected is in the blocklist. The following figure shows the diagnosis information at this diagnostic point.

![CONGESTION_CONTROL](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odp/V4.2.1/en-US/400.routing-diagnosis/600.congestion-control-01.png)

The following are variables to diagnose at the CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point:

* force_retry_congested: indicates whether the OBServer node is forcibly connected even if it is unavailable. The value `true` indicates to forcibly connect the node.

* need_congestion_lookup: indicates whether a blocklist query is required. The value `true` indicates that no blocklist query is required. Some special routing types do not require a blocklist query. For example, you can specify to route a request to the OBServer node whose IP address is 127.0.0.1 and reroute the request to a distributed transaction coordinator node without checking whether the target node is in the blocklist.

* alive_congested/dead_congested/detect_congested: indicates whether the OBServer node is congested. The value `true` indicates that the OBServer node is congested and unavailable, triggering a retry and selecting another OBServer node. The value `false` indicates that this variable will not be returned.

* entry_state: the state of cached data. The value `DIRTY` may result in inaccurate routing. Valid values:

  * BORN: Cache information is just created and no data is available.

  * BUILDING: Cache information is being built.

  * AVAIL: Cache information is available.

  * DIRTY: Cache information has expired, which may result in dirty data.

  * UPDATING: Cache information is being updated.

  * DELETED: Cache information has been deleted or removed. The value `DELETED` indicates that the cache information is unavailable.

* lookup_success: indicates whether the query is successful. The value `false` indicates that the query fails. In this case, the connection is terminated. The value `true` indicates that this variable will be returned.

* entry_exist: indicates whether the allowlist and blocklist corresponding to the OBServer node to be connected exist. The value `false` indicates that the corresponding allowlist and blocklist do not exist. In this case, OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) considers this OBServer node as DEAD_CONGESTED and triggers a retry.

If there are no issues with the CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point, you can check the diagnostic point that records connection establishment information.

* If the OBServer node is unavailable or cannot be connected, ODP performs a retry and returns the RETRY diagnostic point. Note that a retry may result in unexpected routing. For detailed information about the RETRY diagnostic point, see [RETRY](700.retry.md).

* If the OBServer node can be connected, ODP tries to establish a connection with the OBServer node. ODP then receives a packet from the OBServer node. If no partition is hit, the HANDLE_RESPONSE diagnostic point is returned. For detailed information about the HANDLE_RESPONSE diagnostic point, see [HANDLE_RESPONSE](800.handle-response.md).
