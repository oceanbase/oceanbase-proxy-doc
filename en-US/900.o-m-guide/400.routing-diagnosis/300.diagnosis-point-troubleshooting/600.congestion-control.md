# CONGESTION_CONTROL

This topic describes the CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point.

The CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point records access control information. The following table describes the diagnostic information at the CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point.

| Field | Description | Remarks |
|---------|----------|----------|
| svr_addr | The replica address for access control. | N/A |
| alive_congested/dead_congested/detect_congested | Indicates whether the OBServer node is unavailable. | The value `true` indicates that the OBServer node is unavailable. In this case, OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) will reselect an OBServer node. If the value is `false`, this field is not returned in the diagnostic information of this diagnostic point.  |
| force_retry_congested | Indicates whether to force use the replica when it is unavailable. | The value `true` specifies to ignore the unavailability of the OBServer node and force establish a connection.  |
| need_congestion_lookup | Indicates whether to perform access control. | The value `true` specifies not to perform access control. Access control is not required in special routing. For example, if you specify the IP address 127.0.0.1 for routing and configure rerouting to a distributed transaction coordinator, access control is not required.  |
| lookup_success | Indicates whether the query to access control information is successful. | The value `false` indicates a query failure. In this case, the connection will be disconnected. If the value is `true`, this field is still returned in the diagnostic information of this diagnostic point.  |
| entry_exist | Indicates whether the access control information corresponding to `svr_addr` exists. | The value `false` indicates that the corresponding allowlist and blocklist information does not exist. In this case, ODP considers that this OBServer node is in the `DEAD_CONGESTED` state and triggers a retry.  |
