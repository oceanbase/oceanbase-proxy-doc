The following are variables to diagnose at the HANDLE_RESPONSE diagnostic point:

* is_partition_hit: the parsing result in the packet returned by the OBServer node.

* state: the state of the OBServer node. Generally, the value is CONNECTION_ALIVE.

* error: the error code in the packet returned by the OBServer node.

   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p><code>state</code> and <code>error</code> can be used to identify whether inaccurate routing is caused by OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) or the OBServer node. </p>

If ODP fails to establish a connection with the OBServer node, you need to continue to check the RETRY diagnostic point. For detailed information, see [RETRY](700.retry.md).
