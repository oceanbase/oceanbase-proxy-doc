# ROUTE_POLICY

This topic describes the ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point.

The ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point records routing information based on the routing strategy. The following table describes the diagnostic information at the ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point.

| Field | Description | Remarks |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| chosen_route_type | The routing type. | N/A |
| route_policy | The routing strategy. | The default value is `READONLY_ZONE_FIRST`. You can specify the routing strategy by using the `ob_route_policy` session variable. OBServer nodes have different priorities in different routing strategies.  |
| replica | The address of the logical data center (IDC). | For more information about LDC, see [Strategy-based routing](../../../600.data-routing/400.intra-tenant-routing/700.routing-policy-routing.md).  |
| idc_type | The relationship between the replica location and OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP). | Valid values: SAME_IDC, SAME_REGION, and REMOTE. |
| zone_type | The type of the zone where the replica resides. | Valid values: READWRITE and READONLY.  |
| role | The role of the replica. | Valid values: LEADER and FOLLOWER.  |
| type | The type of the replica. | The replica can be a full-featured replica, backup replica, or log replica. For more information, see [Partition replica type](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001106668) in **OceanBase Database documentation**.  |
| is_dup_replica | Indicates whether the replica is a replication table. | Valid values: `DUP` and `-`. For more information about replication tables, see [Create a table](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001105790) in **OceanBase Database documentation**.  |
| is_merging | Indicates whether the replica is in a major compaction. | Valid values: UNMERGE (major compaction in progress) and MERGE (major compaction completed). For more information about major compactions, see [Major compaction](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001105862) in **OceanBase Database documentation**.  |
| is_partition_server | Indicates whether the replica is a partitioned table. | Valid values: PARTITION and NONPARTITION.  |
| is_force_congested | Indicates whether to ignore the situation if the replica is in the blocklist. | N/A |
| proxy_idc_name | The name of the lDC for LDC-based routing in ODP. | For more information about LDC-based routing, see [Strategy-based routing](../../../600.data-routing/400.intra-tenant-routing/700.routing-policy-routing.md). This value is the same as the value of `proxy_idc_name` in ODP.  |
| cluster_primary_zone | The primary zone of the cluster. | For more information about the primary zone, see [Traffic distribution](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001103506) in **OceanBase Database documentation**.  |
| proxy_primary_zone | The primary zone specified in ODP. | The value is the same as that of the ODP parameter [proxy_primary_zone_name](../../../400.configuration-management/200.dynamically-effective/1840.proxy-primary-zone-name.md).  |
| session_consistency | The read consistency level. | The value is the same as that of the [ob_read_consistency](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001105240) system variable of OceanBase Database.  |
| trans_consistency | The transaction consistency. | For more information about transaction consistency, see [Weak consistency read](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001105870) in **OceanBase Database documentation**.  |
