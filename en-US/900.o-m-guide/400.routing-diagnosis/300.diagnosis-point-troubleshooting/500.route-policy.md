# ROUTE_POLICY

This topic describes the ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point.

The ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point only records the parameters required for the corresponding routing strategy and the routing result. The following figure shows the diagnostic information at this diagnostic point.

The following are variables to diagnose at the ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point:

* consistency_level: the read/write consistency level of the request, which can be set through system variables, session variables, request hints, and OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) parameters.

* route_policy: the routing strategy, defaulting to READONLY_ZONE_FIRST. It can be set by the session variable `ob_route_policy`. OBServer nodes will have different priorities in different routing strategies.

* cur_idc_name: the name of the Internet Data Center (IDC) from which the current request is initiated. The IDC can be specified by the ODP parameter `proxy_idc_name`.

* primary_zone: the primary zone of the current tenant. If partition calculation cannot be performed and this parameter is specified, ODP will perform routing according to the zone sequence specified by `primary_zone`.

* proxy_primary_zone: the primary zone specified by the ODP parameter `proxy_primary_zone_name`. If this parameter is specified, ODP will ignore the actual configuration of the primary zone of the tenant.

* chosen_route_type: the routing type of the chosen OBServer node.

* chosen_server: the information about the chosen OBServer node.

  * idc_type: the IDC type. Valid values: SAME_IDC, SAME_REGION, and OTHER_REGION.

  * zone_type: the zone type. Valid values: READWRITE and READONLY.

  * replica

    * server: the IP address and port of the OBServer node, in the *IP address:port* format.

    * is_dup_replica: indicates whether it is a replica of a replicated table.

    * role: indicates whether the partition is a leader or a follower.

    * type: the replica type, such as full-featured replica, backup replica, or log replica.

  * is_merging: indicates whether a major compaction is ongoing.

  * is_partition_server: indicates whether it is a replica of a partitioned table.

  * is_used: This variable is for internal use by ODP and does not need to be concerned about.
