# ROUTE_INFO

This topic describes the ROUTE_INFO diagnostic point.

The following figure shows the diagnostic information at the ROUTE_INFO diagnostic point.

The following are variables to diagnose at the ROUTE_INFO diagnostic point:

* route_info_type: the routing type. Valid values:

  * `USE_CURSOR`/`USE_PIECES`: CURSOR/PIECES routing. If the FETCH, GET_PIECE_DATA, SEND_LONG_DATA, or SEND_PIECE_DATA command word is used in a statement, OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) will select CURSOR/PIECES routing for the statement.

  * `USE_CONFIG_TARGET_DB`/`USE_COMMENT_TARGET_DB`: IP address-based routing. In this scenario, ODP uses an IP address specified by a hint or a parameter for routing.

  * `USE_LAST_SESSION`: reused session routing. If a request is in a transaction, uses forcible routing or temporary table routing, or has function dependencies, the request will be routed together with the previous SQL statement.

  * `USE_COORDINATOR_SESSION`: distributed transaction routing. For more information, see **Transaction routing** in [Intra-tenant routing](../../../600.data-routing/400.intra-tenant-routing.md).

  * `USE_PARTITION_LOCATION_LOOKUP`: specifies to query and calculate partition information and continue to check the diagnostic information at subsequent diagnostic points.

  * `USE_INDEX`: global index routing.

* svr_addr

   The address of the OBServer node for special routing. Routing types, other than `USE_PARTITION_LOCATION_LOOKUP` and `USE_INDEX`, are special ones.

* in_transaction

   Indicates whether the current statement is in a transaction. If the current SQL statement is the first statement in the transaction, the value is `false`. If the value is `true` and if the routing type is not `USE_CURSOR`/`USE_PIECES` (streaming transfer) or `USE_CONFIG_TARGET_DB`/`USE_COMMENT_TARGET_DB`/`USE_TEST_SVR_ADDR`/`USE_OBPROXY_ROUTE_ADDR` (IP address-based routing):

  * For a regular transaction, the value of `route_info_type` must be `USE_LAST_SESSION`.

  * For intra-transaction routing, the value of `route_info_type` must be `USE_COORDINATOR_SESSION`, `USE_PARTITION_LOCATION_LOOKUP`, or `USE_INDEX`.

* dependent_func

   Indicates whether the request has function dependencies. If the value is `true`, the value of `route_info_type` must be `USE_LAST_SESSION`. The following six statements contain function dependencies:

  * show errors;

  * show warnings;

  * show trace;

  * select found_row();

  * select row_count();

  * select connection_id();

* trans_specified

   Indicates whether forcible routing is used. If the value is `true`, the value of `route_info_type` must be `USE_LAST_SESSION`. The following two cases are involved:

  * If a transaction-level temporary table is queried, the request is routed to the coordinator node. In this case, the value of this parameter is `false` and this variable is not returned in diagnostic information.

  * If a session-level temporary table is queried, forcible routing is used. In this case, the value of this parameter is `true`.

If there are no issues with this diagnostic point, you can continue troubleshooting based on the diagnostic information provided.

* If the value of `route_info_type` at the ROUTE_INFO diagnostic point is `USE_PARTITION_LOCATION_LOOKUP` or `USE_INDEX`, ODP will query the partition cache information of the target table in this request. If a stored procedure call is used, check the returned ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point. For more information, see [ROUTINE_ENTRY_LOOKUP](410.routing-entry-lookup.md).

* If the value of `route_info_type` at the ROUTE_INFO diagnostic point is `USE_PARTITION_LOCATION_LOOKUP` or `USE_INDEX`, ODP will query the partition cache information of the target table in this request. If a non-stored procedure call is used, check the returned TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point. For more information, see [TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP](420.table-entry-lookup.md).

* If the value of `route_info_type` at the ROUTE_INFO diagnostic point is not `USE_PARTITION_LOCATION_LOOKUP` or `USE_INDEX`, check the CONGESTION_CONTROL diagnostic point. For more information, see [CONGESTION_CONTROL](600.congestion-control.md).
