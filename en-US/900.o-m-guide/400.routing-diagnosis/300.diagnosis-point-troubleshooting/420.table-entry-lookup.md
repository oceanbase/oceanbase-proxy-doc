# TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP

This topic describes the TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point.

The following figure shows the diagnostic information at the TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point.

The following are variables to diagnose at the TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point:

* table: the name of the table involved in an SQL statement. The value `__all_dummy` specifies to query all tables. If the value is `__all_dummy` and the LOCATION_CACHE_LOOKUP diagnostic point only has the TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP level-2 diagnostic point, inaccurate routing may occur. In this case, ODP will perform routing according to the routing strategy.

* table_id: the ID of the table in OceanBase Database.

* part_num: the number of partitions in the table. If the value is 1, it indicates a regular table without the diagnostic output of partition calculation. If the value is greater than 1, it indicates a partitioned table, for which the PARTITION_ID_CALC_DONE diagnostic point must be checked.

* table_type: the type of the involved table, which can be system table, virtual table, view, or user table.

* entry_state: the state of cached data. The value `DIRTY` may result in inaccurate routing. The value `DELETED` indicates that the cache information is unavailable.

* entry_from_remote: The value `true` indicates that the information is directly returned from an OBServer node. If the information is not returned from an OBServer node, it is possible that the information has been modified on the OBServer node but the latest information is not synchronized to OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), which may result in remote routing.

* has_dup_replica: indicates whether a replicated table is requested. If the value is `true`, a replicated table is requested. In this case, read requests are randomly sent to a follower or the leader that holds the partition, and write requests are sent to the leader.

* is_lookup_succ: indicates whether the query is successful. The value `false` indicates that the query fails. In this case, ODP will perform routing according to the routing strategy.

If there are no issues with this diagnostic point, select the next diagnostic point based on whether the queried table is a partitioned table.

* If the queried table is a partitioned table and the type of the partition key supports partition calculation, you can continue to check the PARTITION_ID_CALC_DONE diagnostic point. For detailed information, see [PARTITION_ID_CALC_DONE](430.partition-id-calc-done.md).

* If the queried table is a non-partitioned table or the type of the partition key does not support partition calculation, you can directly check the ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point. For detailed information, see [ROUTE_POLICY](500.route-policy.md).
