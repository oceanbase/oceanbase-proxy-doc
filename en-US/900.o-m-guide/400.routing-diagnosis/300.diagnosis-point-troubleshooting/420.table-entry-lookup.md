# TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE

This topic describes the TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point.

The TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point records replica location information. The following table describes the diagnostic information at the TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point.

| Field | Description | Remarks |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| table | The name of the table involved in the executed SQL statement. | N/A |
| table_id | The ID of the table in OceanBase Database. | N/A |
| table_type | The type of the table. | Valid values: <ul><li><code>SYSTEM_TABLE</code>: indicates a system table.</li><li><code>SYSTEM_VIEW</code>: indicates a system view.</li><li><code>VIRTUAL_TABLE</code>: indicates a virtual table.</li><li><code>USER_TABLE</code>: indicates a user table.</li><li><code>USER_VIEW</code>: indicates a user view.</li><li><code>USER_INDEX</code>: indicates a user index.</li><li><code>TMP_TABLE</code>: indicates a temporary table.</li></ul> |
| part_num | The number of partitions in the table. | The value `1` indicates a regular table. Diagnostic information about partition calculation is not returned for a regular table. A value greater than 1 indicates a partitioned table.  |
| has_dup_replica | indicates whether a replication table is requested. | If the value is `true`, a replication table is requested. In this case, read requests are randomly forwarded to a follower or the leader that holds the partition, and write requests are forwarded to the leader. For more information about replication tables, see [Create a table](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001105790) in OceanBase Database documentation.  |
| entry_state | The data caching status. | The value `DIRTY` may result in inaccurate routing. The value `DELETED` indicates that the cache information is unavailable.  |
| entry_from_remote | Indicates whether information is returned from an OBServer node in real time. | The value `true` indicates that the information is directly returned from an OBServer node. If the information is not returned from an OBServer node, it is possible that the information has been modified on OBServer nodes but the latest information is not synchronized to ODP, thereby resulting in remote routing.  |
| is_lookup_succ | Indicates whether the query is successful. | The value `false` indicates that the query failed. In this case, routing is performed based on the routing strategy.  |
