# PARTITION_ID_CALC_DONE

This topic describes the PARTITION_ID_CALC_DONE diagnostic point.

The following figure shows the diagnostic information at the PARTITION_ID_CALC_DONE diagnostic point.

The following are variables to diagnose at the PARTITION_ID_CALC_DONE diagnostic point:

* part_level: the level of the partition key, which can determine whether the partition information is obtained correctly. For example, if the value is `1` but the queried table is a sub-partitioned table, there is an issue with obtaining the partition information.

* partitions: the calculated partition location. Compare this value with the output of the `explain` command in OceanBase Database. If they are inconsistent, there is an issue with calculating the partition key.

* parse_sql: the SQL statement actually used by OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) to calculate the partition key. You can check whether the content of this statement meets the expected result.

* ret: If the return value is not `0`, it is possible that partition-related parameters in the SQL statement are incorrect or queries on this type of partitioned table are not supported. In this case, contact OceanBase Technical Support or submit a question on the [Q&A](https://ask.oceanbase.com/) page of the OceanBase open-source community. If the value of `ret` is not `0`, ODP will not calculate the PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point.

If there are no issues with this diagnostic point, you can continue to check the PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point. For detailed information, see [PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP](440.partition-entry-lookup.md).
