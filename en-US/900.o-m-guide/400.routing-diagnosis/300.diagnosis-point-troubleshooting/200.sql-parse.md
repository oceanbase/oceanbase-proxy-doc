The SQL_PARSE diagnostic point mainly checks whether a table name can be successfully parsed. The following are variables to diagnose at this diagnostic point:

* table: the table name involved in an SQL request. If the SQL request is too complex, the table name may fail to be parsed, resulting in inaccurate routing.

* sql: the SQL statement involved in diagnostics. If the SQL statement exceeds 4 KB in length, the table name may fail to be parsed, resulting in inaccurate routing.

* sql_cmd: the command word in the SQL request.

If there are no issues with this diagnostic point, you can continue to check the ROUTE_INFO diagnostic point. For detailed information, see [ROUTE_INFO](300.route_info.md).
