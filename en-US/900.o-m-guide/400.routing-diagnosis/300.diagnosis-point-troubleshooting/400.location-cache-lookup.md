The following are variables to diagnose at the LOCATION_CACHE_LOOKUP diagnostic point:

* mode: the routing mode. Valid values: oceanbase(standard routing mode), and random (random routing). Generally, the value is `oceanbase`.

* need_location_cache_lookup: indicates whether there is a need to query the cache information of the partitioned table (TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP/PARTITION_ID_CACL_DONE, etc.). Generally, the value is `true`.

For a query on a partitioned table, only one LOCATION_CACHE_LOOKUP diagnostic point is returned. If the value of `table` at the level-2 diagnostic point TABLE_ENTRY_LOOKUP is `__all_dummy`, the cache information of all OBServer nodes in the tenant will be queried, and random routing may be performed within the tenant. The routing result may be a partition miss.
