# EXPR_PARSE

This topic describes the EXPR_PARSE diagnostic point.

The EXPR_PARSE diagnostic point records information about partitioning columns and values provided in the parsed statement. This diagnostic point has only one field `col_val`. Here is an example.

If the `SELECT * FROM T WHERE C1 = 123 AND C2 = 'abc';` statement is executed to query the partitioned table T that has two partitioning columns C1 and C2, the `col_val` value in the diagnostic log is "C1=123,C2=abc".
