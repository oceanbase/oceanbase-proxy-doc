# PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP

This topic describes the PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point.

The following figure shows the diagnostic information at the PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point.

The following are variables to diagnose at the PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP diagnostic point:

* part_id: the ID of the partition.

* from_remote: The value `true` indicates that the information is directly returned from an OBServer node. If the information is not returned from an OBServer node, it is possible that the information has been modified on the OBServer node but the latest information is not synchronized to ODP, which may result in remote routing.

* has_dup_replica: indicates whether a replicated table is queried.

* entry_state: the state of cached data. The value `DIRTY` may result in inaccurate routing. Valid values:

  * BORN: Cache information is just created and no data is available.

  * BUILDING: Cache information is being built.

  * AVAIL: Cache information is available.

  * DIRTY: Cache information has expired, which may result in dirty data.

  * UPDATING: Cache information is being updated.

  * DELETED: Cache information has been deleted or removed. The value `DELETED` indicates that the cache information is unavailable.

* leader: the address of the leader of this partition. If this address is inconsistent with that in the corresponding internal table of OceanBase Database, inaccurate routing occurs.

* is_dup_replica: indicates whether it is a replica of a replicated table.

* is_lookup_succ: indicates whether the query is successful. If the value is `false`, it indicates that the query fails. In this case, ODP will perform routing according to the routing strategy. If the value is `true`, this variable is not returned in diagnostic information.

* role: indicates whether the partition is a leader or a follower.

* type: the type of the replica, such as full-featured replica or log replica. For detailed information about replicas, see [Partition replica types](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-database-en-10000000000850536) in OceanBase Database documentation.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The returned replica type depends on the replica types supported by the version of OceanBase Database in use. </p>

If there are no issues with this diagnostic point, you can continue to check the ROUTE_POLICY diagnostic point. For detailed information, see [ROUTE_POLICY](500.route-policy.md).
