# PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE

This topic describes the PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point.

The PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point records information about querying the partition location based on the partition ID. The following table describes the diagnostic information at the PARTITION_ENTRY_LOOKUP_DONE diagnostic point.

| Field | Description | Remarks |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Leader | The address of the server where the leader of this partition resides. | You can query the relevant internal table in OceanBase Database to check whether this server address is consistent with the one returned here. If they are inconsistent, inaccurate routing occurs.  |
| has_dup_replica | Indicates whether the replica is a replication table. | For more information about replication tables, see [Create a table](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001105790) in OceanBase Database documentation.  |
| entry_state | The data caching status. |  The value `DIRTY` may result in inaccurate routing. Valid values: </li><li><code>BORN: Cache information is just created and no data is available.</code> </li><li><code>BUILDING: Cache information is being built.</code> </li><li><code>AVAIL: Cache information is available.</code> </li><li><code>DIRTY: Cache information has expired, which will result in dirty data.</code> </li><li><code>UPDATING: Cache information is being updated.</code> </li><li><code>DELETED</code>: Cache information has been deleted or removed. The value `DELETED` indicates that the cache information is unavailable. </li></ul> |
| entry_from_remote | Indicates whether information is returned from an OBServer node in real time. | The value `true` indicates that the information is directly returned from an OBServer node. If the information is not returned from an OBServer node, it is possible that the information has been modified on OBServer nodes but the latest information is not synchronized to OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), thereby resulting in remote routing.  |
| is_lookup_succ | Indicates whether the query is successful. | The value `false` indicates that the query failed. In this case, routing is performed based on the routing strategy. If the value is `true`, this field is not returned in the diagnostic information of this diagnostic point.  |
