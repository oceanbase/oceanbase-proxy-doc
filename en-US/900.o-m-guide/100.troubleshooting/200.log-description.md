# Monitoring logs

Three tools are available to resolve OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) issues: ODP logs, Linux commands (including network commands, system commands, and text commands), and OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). Reference materials about Linux commands and OCP are common on the Internet. We recommend that you learn the related knowledge to facilitate troubleshooting.

This topic describes ODP logs of different types.

## Audit logs

Audit logs are recorded in the `obproxy_digest.log` file. It records requests whose execution time exceeds the threshold specified by the `query_digest_time_threshold` parameter, and requests with incorrect responses.

* Log format

   ```bash
   Log printing time, current application name, trace ID, RPC ID, name of the logical data source, physical database information (cluster:tenant:database), database type (OB or RDS), name of the logical table, name of the physical table, SQL command, SQL type (CRUD), execution result (success or failed), error code (empty when the execution result is success), SQL statement, total SQL execution time (in us), pre-execution time, link establishment time, database execution time, current thread name, shard name, whether BT mode is used, system penetration data, and penetration data
   ```

   Notes:

  * The `SQL command` can be `COM_QUERY` or `COM_STMT_PREPARE`.

  * The `total execution time` includes the execution time of internal SQL statements.

  * The `current thread name` indicates the internal thread ID of the ODP.

  * The information about the `shard name` and `whether BT mode is used` can be printed in logs only in V2.0.20 and later. The value `1` indicates that the BT mode is used and the value `0` indicates that the BT mode is not used.

  * The `system penetration data` indicates the disaster recovery information of the system.

* Example

   In this example, `select sleep(3) from dual` is used to simulate a slow SQL statement. After this statement is executed, view the `obproxy_digest.log` file. The log shows that the execution time on ODP is 409 μs and the execution time on the OBServer is 3039883 μs. The following example shows the content of the log:

   ```bash
   2022-07-11 14:32:51.758265,undefined,,,,obcluster:sys:test,OB_MYSQL,,,COM_QUERY,SELECT,success,,select sleep(3),3041116us,409us,0us,3039883us,Y0-7F4B1CEA13A0,,,,0,11.xxx.xxx.53:33041
   # The log fields are separated with commas (,). If the SQL statement contains a comma, it will be replaced with %2C. The result after replacement by using tr ',' '\n' is as follows:
      1,2022-07-11 14:32:51.758265    # The log printing time.
      2,undefined          # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      3,                   # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      4,                   # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      5,                   # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      6,obcluster:sys:test  # The information about the physical database, in the format of cluster name:tenant name:database name.
      7,OB_MYSQL         # The database type.
      8,                 # The name of the logical table.
      9,                 # The name of the physical table.
      10,COM_QUERY       # The SQL command, for example, COM_QUERY or COM_STMT_PREPARE.
      11,SELECT          # The SQL type.
      12,success         # The execution result. Valid value: success or failed.
      13,                # The error code, which is empty when the execution result is success.
      14,select sleep(3) # The SQL statement.
      15,3041116us       # The total execution time in us, including the execution time of internal SQL statements.
      16,409us           # The pre-execution time.
      17,0us             # The connection establishment time.
      18,3039883us       # The database execution time.
      19,Y0-7F4B1CEA13A0 # The trace ID of the internal log of the ODP.
      20,                # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      21,                # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      22,                # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      23,0               # It is for internal use. You do not need to pay attention to it.
      24,11.xxx.xxx.53:33041  # The address of the OBServer to route to.
   ```

In an audit log, the 14th line records the executed SQL statement, and the 15th and 16th lines record the detailed execution time. If the execution in the database is slow, the time recorded in the 18th line is long.

## SQL execution statistic logs

The `obproxy_stat.log` file records the SQL execution statistic logs. By default, a statistic log is generated once every minute. The generation interval is specified by the `monitor_stat_dump_interval` parameter. In this log, you can view the SQL statements executed by ODP within one minute.

* Log format

```bash
Log printing time, current application name, name of the logical data source, physical database information (cluster:tenant:database), database type (OB or RDS), SQL type (CRUD), execution result (success or failed), error code (empty when the execution result is success), total requests, requests with an execution time in the range of [30 ms, 100 ms), requests with an execution time in the range of [100 ms, 500 ms), requests with an execution time greater than or equal to 500 ms, total execution time (in us, including the execution time of internal SQL statements), pre-execution time, and database execution time
```

* Example

   To check whether ODP has request traffic, view this log record. Example:

   ```bash
   2022-07-11 10:26:59.499204,undefined,,obcluster:sys:test,OB_MYSQL,SELECT,success,,1,1,0,0,41480us,332us,40369us

   # Log analysis
   1,2022-07-11 10:26:59.499204   # The log printing time.
   2,undefined      # The logical tenant name.
   3,               # The name of the logical database.
   4,obcluster:sys:test  # The information about the physical database, in the format of cluster name:tenant name:database name.
   5,OB_MYSQL  # The database type.
   6,SELECT    # The SQL type.
   7,success   # The execution result. Valid value: success or failed.
   8,          # The error code, which is empty when the execution result is success.
   9,1         # The total number of requests.
   10,1           # The number of requests whose execution time ranges from 30 ms to 100 ms.
   11,0           # The number of requests whose execution time ranges from 100 ms to 500 ms.
   12,0           # The number of requests whose execution time is greater than 500 ms.
   13,41480us     # The total execution time in us, including the execution time of internal SQL statements.
   14,332us       # The pre-execution time.
   15,40369u      # The database execution time.
   ```

## Slow SQL request logs

The `obproxy_slow.log` file logs slow SQL requests. Requests with the execution time greater than the threshold (default value: 500 ms) specified by the `slow_query_time_threshold` parameter are recorded.

* Log format

   ```bash
   Log printing time, current application name, trace ID, RPC ID, name of the logical data source, physical database information (cluster:tenant:database), database type (OB or RDS), name of the logical table, name of the physical table, SQL command, SQL type (CRUD), execution result (success or failed), error code (empty when the execution result is success), SQL statement, total SQL execution time (in us), pre-execution time, link establishment time, database execution time, current thread name, system penetration data, and penetration data
   ```

   Notes:

  * The `SQL command` can be `COM_QUERY` or `COM_STMT_PREPARE`.

  * The `total execution time` includes the execution time of internal SQL statements.

  * The `current thread name` indicates the internal thread ID of the ODP.

  * The `system penetration data` indicates the disaster recovery information of the system.

* Example

   ```bash
   2022-07-11 14:32:51.758270,undefined,,,,obcluster:sys:test,OB_MYSQL,,,COM_QUERY,SELECT,success,,select sleep(3),3041116us,409us,0us,3039883us,Y0-7F4B1CEA13A0,,,,0,11.xxx.xxx.53:33041
   ```

The `obproxy.log` file also records slow SQL queries and the keyword is `Slow Query`. The information recorded in the `obproxy.log` file is more detailed. For example, after the `select sleep(3) from dual` SQL statement is executed, you can find the following information in the `obproxy.log` file:

## ODP error logs

The `obproxy_error.log` file records ODP error logs. Queries with an execution error are logged in this log file, including ODP errors and errors returned by the OBServer.

* Log format

   ```bash
   Log printing time, current application name, trace ID, RPC ID, name of the logical data source, physical database information (cluster:tenant:database), database type (OB or RDS), name of the logical table, name of the physical table, SQL command, SQL type (CRUD), execution result (success or failed), error code (empty when the execution result is success), SQL statement, total SQL execution time (in us), pre-execution time, link establishment time, database execution time, current thread name, system penetration data, penetration data, and error details
   ```

   Notes:

  * The `SQL command` can be `COM_QUERY` or `COM_STMT_PREPARE`.

  * The `total execution time` includes the execution time of internal SQL statements.

  * The `current thread name` indicates the internal thread ID of the ODP.

  * The `system penetration data` indicates the disaster recovery information of the system.

* Example

   In the following example, the `select obproxy_error from dual` statement is used. The `obproxy_error` field in the statement is not enclosed by quotation marks and will be treated as a column. This results in an execution failure. The client returns the following error:

   ```sql
   MySQL [test]> select obproxy_error from dual;
   ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'obproxy_error' in 'field list'
   ```

   The `obproxy_error.log` file records the following information for the error:

   ```bash
   2022-07-11 10:26:09.358231,undefined,,,,obcluster:sys:test,OB_MYSQL,,,COM_QUERY,SELECT,failed,1054,select obproxy_error from dual,42423us,454us,0us,41222us,Y0-7F4B1EF653A0,,,,0,11.xxx.xxx.53:33041,Unknown column 'obproxy_error' in 'field list'

   25,Unknown column 'obproxy_error' in 'field list' # The error message.
   ```

   The 12th line shows an execution failure. The 27th line shows the address information about the OBServer that executed the SQL query. The 28th line shows the error message. You can determine, based on the preceding information, that a database execution failure occurred.

## ODP throttling logs

The `obproxy_limit.log` file records ODP throttling logs. Throttled requests are logged in this file.

* Log format

   ```bash
   Log printing time, current application name, trace ID, RPC ID, name of the logical data source, physical database information (cluster:tenant:database), database type (OB or RDS), name of the logical table, name of the physical table, SQL command (such as COM_QUERY or COM_STMT_PREPARE), SQL type (CRUD), throttling status (RUNNING or OBSERVE), SQL statement, and SQL throttling rule name
   ```

* Example

   ```bash
   2020-03-18 21:26:54.871053,postmen,,,,postmen40:postmen_new0497_3279:postmen_r497,OB_MYSQL,,postmen_push_msg_4977,COM_QUERY,SELECT,RUNNING,SELECT    id%2C    gmt_create%2C    gmt_modified%2C    msg_id%2C    principal_id%2C    app_name%2C    target_utdid%2C    biz_id%2C    host%2C    status%2C    expire_time%2C    msg_data   FROM    postmen_push_msg_4977   WHERE    principal_id = 'W/jEKoLOxnwDABWmhzjgmK1V' AND    app_name = 'KOUBEI' AND    expire_time > 1584538014858 AND    status = 1,LIMIT_RULE_1
   ```

## Prometheus

In addition to a log system, ODP further provides the Prometheus system for integration with different monitoring platforms. Prometheus provides information such as the total number of requests, execution time, number of frontend connections, and number of backend connections. The following table describes the monitoring metrics.

| Metric | Required | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| odp_transaction_total | Yes | The total number of transactions. |
| odp_sql_request_total | Yes | The total number of requests. |
| odp_sql_cost_total | Yes | The total execution time of the requests. |
| odp_current_session | Yes | The current number of sessions. |
| odp_entry_total | No | The number of table entry requests. |
| odp_request_byte | No | The number of bytes in the request. |
