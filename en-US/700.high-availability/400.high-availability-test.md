# High availability testing

You can test the high availability feature of ODP. The power supply to the IDC cannot be shut down during business stress testing. You can use sysbench to test the recovery time objective (RTO) of OceanBase Database. In the following example, OBServer 4.0 is tested. Use sysbench to run a stress test. Then run the `kill -9/-19/-18` command on the observer or ODP process and observe the changes of the transactions per second (TPS) metric.

Example:

The preceding data shows that the TPS mildly fluctuates around 500, is sharply dropped during the period from 21s to 27s, and resumes at 28s. Therefore, the RTO is less than 8s.
