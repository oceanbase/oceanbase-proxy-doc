# ssl_attributes

`ssl_attributes` specifies the attributes of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This parameter is introduced since ODP V4.2.1. The <code>min_tls_version</code> key is added since ODP V4.2.2. </p>
</main>

| Attribute | Description |
|----------|---------|
| Parameter type | JSON string |
| Default value | Empty string |
| Value range | N/A |

## Considerations

In a JSON string, the first key is using-ssl, which specifies to force use SSL for connection establishment. The second key is min_tls_version, which specifies the Transport Layer Security (TLS) version for SSL connections. Valid values of min_tls_version are described as follows:

* `none`: indicates no limitation.

* {"min_tls_version" : "tlsv1"}: The earlier version is tlsv1.

* {"min_tls_version" : "tlsv1.1"}: The earliest version is tlsv1.1. In this case, logon with tlsv1 will be rejected.

* {"min_tls_version" : "tlsv1.2"}: The earliest version is tlsv1.2. In this case, logon with tlsv1 or tlsv1.1 will be rejected.

* {"min_tls_version" : "tlsv1.3"}: The earliest version is tlsv1.3. In this case, logon with tlsv1, tlsv1.1, or tlsv1.2 will be rejected.

## Examples

```sql
alter proxyconfig set ssl_attributes = '{"using_ssl" : "ENABLE_FORCE", "min_tls_version" : "TLSV1.1"}';
```
