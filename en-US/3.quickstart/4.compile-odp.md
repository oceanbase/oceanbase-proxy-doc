Compile the source code of ODP 
===================================================

This topic describes how to compile the source code to customize OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) and test its latest features. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

Before you compile an ODP build, make sure that your server meets the following requirements:

* Operating system: CentOS 7/8 (x86)

  

* Number of servers: 1

  

* Minimum hardware specifications:

  

* Recommended hardware specifications:

  




Clone the repository 
-----------------------------------------

Run the following command to clone the ODP source code repository to your server:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:oceanbase/obproxy
```


**Notice**



To clone the repository, you must install and configure Git first. For more information, see [Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) on Git.

Get compilation dependencies 
-------------------------------------------------

Most of the compilation dependencies are hosted in the official YUM repository of OceanBase Database. Run the following command to confirm whether your server has access to the YUM repository. 

```shell
curl http://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
```



If yes, you can get the compilation dependencies through the following methods:

* Run the following command to install the global dependency:

  ```shell
  yum install wget rpm* cpio make glibc-devel glibc-headers
  ```

  

* Run the following command to install the local dependency:

  ```shell
  sh build.sh init
  ```

  
  **Notice**

  

  To install the local dependency, you need the wget, rpm2cpio, and cpio utilities.
  

* Compile dependencies

  You can also compile the dependencies in the `deps/3rd` directory. The following table shows programs required for compiling dependencies.

Compile your ODP build 
-------------------------------------------

ODP is built by using Automake. You can either run Automake commands to create a directory and build it, or use the `build.sh` script to build it quickly. You can select one of the following compilation methods as needed.

* DEBUG compilation

  ```shell
  sh build.sh init
  sh build.sh config debug
  sh build.sh make
  ```

  

* RELEASE compilation

  ```shell
  sh build.sh init
  sh build.sh config
  sh build.sh make
  ```

  

* Create an RPM package (optional)

  ```shell
  sh build.sh rpm
  ```

  
  **Notice**

  

  To create an RPM package, you must install the rpm and rpmbuild utilities.
  




Subsequent operations 
------------------------------------------

After the ODP build is compiled, you can use OceanBase Deployer (OBD) to deploy it. For more information, see [OBD Documentation](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/blob/master/README.md).
