# Deployment modes

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).

The deployment mode varies with the real physical environment and business requirements. When you deploy ODP in a production environment, take the following factors into consideration:

* Delivery mode

   ODP is delivered in an RPM package or in Docker mode. ODP is deployed from an RPM package when it is deployed by using OceanBase Cloud Platform or the CLI. On the platform as a service (PaaS) platform of Ant Group, ODP starts in Docker mode.

* Quantity

   The number of ODPs that can be deployed is related with the number of applications or OBServers, depending on the specific deployment mode.

* Deployment modes

   The response time and resource preemption strategies vary with the deployment mode, and the deployment mode significantly affects the performance. ODP supports three deployment modes: deployment on the application side, deployment on the OBServer side, and independent deployment.

## Deployment on the application side

ODP can be deployed in sidebar mode along with applications on a physical server by using the cloud-native technology. In this deployment mode, the number of ODPs is the same as that of applications. ODP is directly connected to the OceanBase Database without load balancing (LB) components in between.

Experience has suggested that this deployment mode has the best performance. In this deployment, it must be ensured that the applications, ODPs, and OBServers can communicate with each other over the network.

In this mode, the number of ODPs must be the same as the number of APPs. This results in a large number of ODP containers, which can even reach tens of thousands. Therefore, this mode depends on the underlying Kubernetes and other infrastructure.

## Deployment on the OBServer side

ODP deployment on the OBServer side means that one ODP process on deployed on one OBServer. In this way, the number of ODPs is the same as that of OBServers. Compared with [deployment on the application side](#Deployment%20on%20the%20application%20side), this deployment mode does not involve the correspondence between the numbers of applications and ODPs. You can also deploy one ODP in each zone.

The following figure shows a common ODP deployment mode in Apsara Stack.

This deployment mode differs from the ODP deployment on the application side in the following aspects:

1. More LB components are used to balance the ODP load, and the link is longer.

2. The applications and ODPs are not in one-to-one correspondence. Therefore, it will be more difficult to troubleshoot issues.

3. The ODP is deployed on the OBServer. CPU and memory resource preemption may occur on the machine in case of heavy load.

## Independent deployment

In independent deployment mode, ODP is deployed on a dedicated server. The number of ODPs is not related to the number of applications or OBServers, but depends on specific business requirements.

We recommend that you use a midrange computer, for example, a 16C 16G ECS instance. In independent deployment mode, resource preemption between the OBServer and ODP will not occur. You can better manage ODP and use ODP as a resource pool to provide external services. Currently, this deployment mode is used in a public cloud.
