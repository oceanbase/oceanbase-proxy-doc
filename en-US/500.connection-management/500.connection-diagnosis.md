# Connection diagnostics

This topic describes how to troubleshoot disconnections.

## Background information

The execution link of a request on OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) is as follows: a client sends a request to ODP, ODP routes the request to the corresponding OBServer node, the OBServer node processes the request and returns a packet to ODP, and ODP returns the packet to the client. A disconnection can occur on the link in the following cases: the client does not receive a packet from ODP due to a long request processing time, logon fails due to incorrect cluster or tenant information, and an internal error occurs in ODP or OceanBase Database.

When a disconnection occurs, you can perform preliminary troubleshooting based on the information in the error packet returned from the OBServer node. However, the information provided in an error packet is insufficient for locating the issue, and no error packet is returned in some scenarios. In this case, you need to check the whole link. ODP provides connection diagnostic records to serve this purpose.

## Diagnostic method

After a disconnection occurs, ODP generates a disconnection log in the `obproxy_diagnosis.log` file to record detailed information about the disconnection. The following is a disconnection log that records a logon failure due to an incorrect tenant name.

```shell
[2023-08-23 20:11:08.567425] [109316][Y0-00007F285BADB4E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="LOGIN_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:1031798792, ss_id:0, proxy_session_id:0, server_session_id:0, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:58218", server_addr:"*Not IP address [0]*:0", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"test", user_name:"root", error_code:-4043, error_msg:"dummy entry is empty, please check if the tenant exists", request_cmd:"COM_SLEEP", sql_cmd:"COM_LOGIN"}{internal_sql:""})
```

The general fields in a log are described as follows:

* LOG_TIME: the time when the log was recorded, which is `2023-08-23 20:11:08.567425` in this example.

* TID: the ID of the thread, which is `109316` in this example.

* TRACE_ID: the trace ID, which is `Y0-00007F285BADB4E0` in this example. You can associate the log with other logs based on the trace ID.

* CONNECTION: indicates that this log is related to connection diagnostics.

* trace_type: the diagnostic type, which varies based on the cause of disconnection. Valid values:

  * LOGIN_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by a logon failure.

  * SERVER_INTERNAL_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by an internal error in OceanBase Database.

  * PROXY_INTERNAL_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by an internal error of ODP.

  * CLIENT_VC_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is actively initiated by the client.

  * SERVER_VC_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is actively initiated by OceanBase Database.

  * TIMEOUT_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by an execution timeout of the ODP process.

* CS_ID: the internal ID used by ODP to identify the client connection.

* SS_ID: the internal ID used by ODP to identify the connection between ODP and OceanBase Database.

* PROXY_SS_ID: the ID generated by ODP to identify the client connection. This ID is passed to OceanBase Database and can be used to filter OceanBase Database logs or the sql_audit table.

* SERVER_SS_ID: the ID generated by OceanBase Database to identify the connection between ODP and OceanBase Database.

* CLIENT_ADDR: the IP address of the client.

* SERVER_ADDR: the IP address of the OBServer node when an error or disconnection occurs.

* CLUSTER_NAME: the name of the cluster.

* TENANT_NAME: the name of the tenant.

* USER_NAME: the username.

* ERROR_CODE: the error code.

* ERROR_MSG: the error message, which is the key information for diagnosing disconnections.

* REQUEST_CMD: the type of the statement being executed by ODP, which can be an internal request.

* SQL_CMD: the type of the user statement.

Besides the preceding general information, a diagnostic log can contain additional diagnostic information, which is subject to the diagnostic type.

## General disconnection scenarios

This section describes several common disconnection scenarios and how to locate and resolve these disconnections.

### Disconnection upon a logon failure

The diagnostic type is LOGIN_TRACE. Here is a sample diagnostic log that records a disconnection caused by an incorrect tenant name during logon.

```shell
[2023-09-08 10:37:21.028960] [90663][Y0-00007F8EB76544E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="LOGIN_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:1031798785, ss_id:0, proxy_session_id:0, server_session_id:0, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:44018", server_addr:"*Not IP address [0]*:0", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"sys", user_name:"root", error_code:-10018, error_msg:"fail to check observer version, empty result", request_cmd:"COM_SLEEP", sql_cmd:"COM_LOGIN"}{internal_sql:"SELECT ob_version() AS cluster_version"})
```

The additional diagnostic information is `internal_sql`, which indicates that an internal request is being executed by ODP.

The causes of a disconnection upon a logon failure are complex. This section introduces the causes and solutions from the perspectives of user operations and OceanBase Database.

The following table describes the disconnection scenarios of user operations and the corresponding solutions.

| Scenario | Error code | Error message | Solution |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| The cluster name is incorrect | 4669 | cluster xxx does not exist | Make sure that the corresponding cluster exists and the cluster name is correct. You can directly connect to the OBServer node and run the `show parameters like 'cluster';` command for verification. The `value` value in the output is the name of the cluster to connect to.  |
| The tenant name is incorrect | 4043 | dummy entry is empty, please check if the tenant exists | Make sure that the corresponding tenant exists. You can directly connect to the OBServer node as the root@sys user and run the `SELECT * FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS;` command to view all tenants in the cluster.  |
| ODP allowlist verification fails | 8205 | user xxx@xxx can not pass white list | Check whether ODP allowlists are correctly configured in the console. For more information, see [Configure the allowlist of IP addresses](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-cloud-10000000000924005) in OceanBase Cloud documentation.  |
| OceanBase Database allowlist verification fails | 1227 | Access denied | View the [ob_tcp_invited_nodes](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001105243) variable to check whether OceanBase Database allowlists are correctly configured.  |
| The number of client connections reaches the upper limit | 5059 | too many sessions | Run the `ALTER proxyconfig SET <var_name> = <var_value>;` command to modify the ODP parameter `client_max_connections` to work around this issue.  |
| ODP is configured to use the Security Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol but a user request is initiated by using a non-SSL protocol | 8004 | obproxy is configured to use ssl connection | Change the value of the `enable_client_ssl` parameter to `false`, which specifies not to use SSL for connections, or initiate an SSL access request.  |
| The proxyro@sys user is used to directly access OceanBase Database | 10021 | user proxyro is rejected while proxyro_check on | You cannot directly access OceanBase Database as the proxyro@sys user.  |
| A cloud user uses a username in the three-segment format for access when `enable_cloud_full_user_name` is disabled | 10021 | connection with cluster name and tenant name is rejected while cloud_full_user_name_check off | When `enable_cloud_full_user_name` is disabled, ODP does not support access by using a username in the three-segment format. You can enable the `enable_cloud_full_user_name` parameter or access by using a regular username not in the three-segment format.  |
| The password of the proxyro user is incorrect | 10018 | fail to check observer version, proxyro@sys access denied, error resp { code:1045, msg:Access denied for user xxx } | If the default password for the proxyro user is retained, no error occurs. If you manually change the password of the proxyro@sys user in OceanBase Database, make sure that the value of the ODP parameter `observer_sys_password` is the same as the new password of proxyro@sys.  |
| The configured RootService list is unavailable when ODP is started | 10018 | fail to check observer version, empty result | Directly connect to the OBServer node and run the `SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'rootservice_list';` command to view the RootService of OceanBase Database to check whether the configured server IP address is available when ODP is started.  |

The following table describes the disconnection scenarios of OceanBase Database and the corresponding solutions.

| Scenario | Error code | Error message | Solution |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| The return result of a cluster information query is empty | 4669 | cluster info is empty | Directly connect to OceanBase Database and execute an SQL statement and view the internal_sql field in the output to check whether the cluster information returned from OceanBase Database is empty.  |
| Cluster information query fails | 10018 | fail to check observer version</br>fail to check cluster info</br>fail to init server state | Directly connect to OceanBase Database and execute an SQL statement and view the internal_sql field in the output to check whether the cluster information returned from OceanBase Database is empty.  |
| Information query on the Config Server fails | 10301 | fail to fetch root server list from config server</br>fail to fetch root server list from local | Manually pull the Config Server URL configured by the `obproxy_config_server_url` parameter at startup to check whether the information returned by the Config Server is normal.  |

### Disconnection upon timeout

The diagnostic type is TIMEOUT_TRACE. Here is a sample diagnostic log that records a disconnection caused by the timeout of cluster information.

```shell

### Disconnection initiated by OceanBase Database

The diagnostic type is SERVER_VC_TRACE. Here is a sample diagnostic log that records a disconnection when ODP fails to establish a connection with OceanBase Database.

```shell
[2023-08-10 23:35:00.132805] [32339][Y0-00007F74C9A244E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="SERVER_VC_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:838860809, ss_id:0, proxy_session_id:7230691830869983240, server_session_id:0, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:45765", server_addr:"", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"sys", user_name:"root", error_code:-10013, error_msg:"Fail to build connection to observer", request_cmd:"COM_QUERY", sql_cmd:"COM_HANDSHAKE"}{vc_event:"unknown event", total_time(us):2952626, user_sql:"select 1 from dual"})
```

The additional fields are described as follows:

* `vc_event`: indicates the time of the disconnection event. You do not need to concern about this field.

* `total_time`: indicates the request execution time.

* `user_sql`: indicates a user request.

The following table describes the scenarios of disconnection actively initiated by OceanBase Database and the solutions.

| Scenario | Error code | Error message | Solution |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>When OceanBase Database actively disconnects from ODP, ODP cannot collect detailed information. If the status of the OBServer node configured in ODP is normal, you need to perform diagnostics based on the relevant logs of OceanBase Database. </p>
</main>

### Disconnection initiated by the client

The diagnostic type is CLIENT_VC_TRACE. Here is a sample diagnostic log that records a disconnection initiated by the client when ODP reads the request.

```shell
[2023-08-10 23:28:24.699168] [32339][Y0-00007F74C9A244E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="CLIENT_VC_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:838860807, ss_id:26, proxy_session_id:7230691830869983239, server_session_id:3221698209, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:44701", server_addr:"10.10.10.1:21100", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"sys", user_name:"root", error_code:-10010, error_msg:"An EOS event received from client while obproxy reading request", request_cmd:"COM_SLEEP", sql_cmd:"COM_END"}{vc_event:"VC_EVENT_EOS", total_time(us):57637, user_sql:""})

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>When the client is disconnected from ODP, ODP cannot collect detailed information but the action of the client to actively disconnect from ODP. Active disconnections can be triggered by driver timeout, initiated by middleware such as Druid, Hikaricp, and Nginx, or caused by network jitters. You can perform diagnostics based on relevant logs of the client. </p>
</main>

### Disconnection upon internal errors of ODP of OceanBase Database

The diagnostic type is PROXY_INTERNAL_TRACE for disconnections caused by internal errors of ODP, and is SERVER_INTERNAL_TRACE for disconnections caused by internal errors of OceanBase Database. Here is a sample diagnostic log that records a disconnection caused by an internal error of ODP.

```shell
[2023-08-10 23:26:12.558201] [32339][Y0-00007F74C9A244E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="PROXY_INTERNAL_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:838860805, ss_id:0, proxy_session_id:7230691830869983237, server_session_id:0, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:44379", server_addr:"", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"sys", user_name:"root", error_code:-10019, error_msg:"OBProxy reached the maximum number of retrying request", request_cmd:"COM_QUERY", sql_cmd:"COM_QUERY"}{user_sql:"USE `ý<8f>ý<91>ý<92>`"})
```

| Other sessions are killed. | 5065 | connection was killed by user session xxx | This is an expected scenario and is recorded in diagnostic logs.  |

Here is a sample diagnostic log. `user_sql` is an additional field that indicates the user request SQL.

```shell
[2023-08-10 23:27:15.107427] [32339][Y0-00007F74CAAE84E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="PROXY_INTERNAL_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:838860806, ss_id:21, proxy_session_id:7230691830869983238, server_session_id:3221695443, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:44536", server_addr:"10.10.10.1:21100", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"sys", user_name:"", error_code:-5065, error_msg:"connection was killed by user self, cs_id: 838860806", request_cmd:"COM_QUERY", sql_cmd:"COM_QUERY"}{user_sql:"kill 838860806"})
```

## Examples

The following figure shows the general links of requests initiated by a client to OceanBase Database.

![Link diagram](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odp/V4.2.2/zh-CN/500.connection-management/500.connection-diagnosis-01.png)

A request initiated by a client to OceanBase Database needs to pass multiple nodes. The client connection can be disconnected when an error occurs on any node. Therefore, when a connection is disconnected but the client does not receive any explicit error packet to indicate the cause of the disconnection, identify the node where the disconnection occurs and then find the cause based on the relevant logs on this node. To do so, perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Identify the node where the disconnection occurs

If the current ODP is capable of connection diagnostics, you can quickly identify the node where the disconnection occurs based on the `obproxy_diagnosis.log` file. You can quickly find the disconnection log based on information such as the username, tenant name, cluster name, thread ID (corresponding to cs_id in the log file) obtained from the driver, and the time when the disconnection occurred. Then, determine the node where the disconnection occurs based on the trace_type field. Valid values of trace_type:

* CLIENT_VC_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is initiated by the client.

* SERVER_VC_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is initiated by OceanBase Database.

* SERVER_INTERNAL_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by an internal error in OceanBase Database.

* PROXY_INTERNAL_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by an internal error of ODP.

* LOGIN_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by a logon failure.

* TIMEOUT_TRACE: indicates that the disconnection is caused by a timeout.

### Step 2: Identify the cause of disconnection

You can identify the cause of the disconnection based on the node where the disconnection occurs.

#### Disconnection initiated by the client

The default value of `socketTimeout` is 0 for JDBC, which indicates no socket timeout. However, some clients such as Druid and MyBatis have a socket timeout parameter. If a disconnection occurs due to a long request execution time, you can first check the socket timeout value. For more information, see [Database connection pool configuration](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001106115) in OceanBase Database documentation.

1. View basic information about the disconnection in the connection diagnostic logs of ODP.

   ```shell
   [2023-09-07 15:59:52.308553] [122701][Y0-00007F7071D194E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="CLIENT_VC_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:524328, ss_id:0, proxy_session_id:7230691833961840700, server_session_id:0, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:38877", server_addr:"10.10.10.2:50110", cluster_name:"ob1.changluo.cc.10.10.10.2", tenant_name:"mysql", user_name:"root", error_code:-10011, error_msg:"An unexpected connection event received from client while obproxy handling request", request_cmd:"COM_QUERY", sql_cmd:"COM_QUERY"}{vc_event:"VC_EVENT_EOS", total_time(us):5016353, user_sql:"select sleep(20) from dual"})
   ```

   The fields in the diagnostic information are described as follows:

   * trace_type: the diagnostic type, which is `CLIENT_VC_TRACE` in this example, indicating that the disconnection is initiated by the client.

   * error_msg: the error message, which is `An unexpected connection event received from client while obproxy handling request` in this example, indicating that the client initiates a disconnection when ODP processes a request.

   * total_time: the request execution time, which is `5016353` in this example, indicating that the total request execution time is about 5s. You can check the timeout value on the client.

2. View the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) stack of the client.

   The stack and packet sending and receiving time indicate that the client initiates a disconnection due to socket timeout.

#### Disconnection initiated by ODP

ODP reads the `net_write_timeout` value from OceanBase Database to control the timeout value for packet transmission. The default value is 60s. In the case of extreme network environment conditions or if OceanBase Database does not return a packet after a long period, ODP may be disconnected due to a timeout. Here takes the scenario where a timeout occurs when ODP waits for a response packet from OceanBase Database as an example.

Determine the node where the disconnection occurs based on the diagnostic logs of ODP.

```shell
[2023-09-08 01:22:17.229436] [81506][Y0-00007F455197E4E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="TIMEOUT_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:1031798827, ss_id:342, proxy_session_id:7230691830869983244, server_session_id:3221753829, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:34901", server_addr:"10.10.10.1:21102", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"mysql", user_name:"root", error_code:-10022, error_msg:"OBProxy inactivity timeout", request_cmd:"COM_QUERY", sql_cmd:"COM_QUERY"}{timeout(us):6000000, timeout_event:"CLIENT_NET_WRITE_TIMEOUT", total_time(us):31165295})
```

The fields in the diagnostic information are described as follows:

* trace_type: the diagnostic type, which is `TIMEOUT_TRACE` in this example, indicating that the disconnection occurs due to an execution timeout of ODP.

* timeout_event: the timeout event, which is `CLIENT_NET_WRITE_TIMEOUT` in this example, indicating that a timeout occurs when ODP waits for a response packet from OceanBase Database.

The diagnostic information indicates that net_write_timeout is triggered. The client connection is disconnected after being left unattended for more than 6s (not the default value). In this case, you can change the timeout period to a larger value to work around this issue.

#### Disconnection triggered by a logon failure

This section provides two scenarios.

* Scenario 1: The OBServer node specified in the RootService list is unavailable. Here is a sample diagnostic log.

   ```shell
   [2023-09-08 10:37:21.028960] [90663][Y0-00007F8EB76544E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="LOGIN_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:1031798785, ss_id:0, proxy_session_id:0, server_session_id:0, client_addr:"10.10.10.1:44018", server_addr:"*Not IP address [0]*:0", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"sys", user_name:"root", error_code:-10018, error_msg:"fail to check observer version, empty result", request_cmd:"COM_SLEEP", sql_cmd:"COM_LOGIN"}{internal_sql:"SELECT ob_version() AS cluster_version"})
   ```

   The fields in the diagnostic information are described as follows:

   * `trace_type`: the diagnostic type, which is `LOGIN_TRACE` in this example, indicating that the disconnection is caused by a logon failure.

   * `internal_sql`: the internal request being executed by ODP, which is `SELECT ob_version() AS cluster_version` in this example, indicating that ODP fails to execute this internal request during logon.

   * `error_msg`: the error message, which is `fail to check observer version, empty result` in this example, indicating that the cause of the request execution failure is that the result set is empty.

   To sum up, ODP fails to execute the internal request `SELECT ob_version() AS cluster_version` because the result set is empty. The SQL statement `SELECT ob_version() AS cluster_version` is a request for ODP to query the cluster version. ODP executes this request to verify the cluster information when you log on for the first time. If the RootService list configured when ODP is started is incorrect or if the OBServer node breaks down, the query will fail, thereby causing a logon failure.

* Scenario 2: The number of client connections reaches the upper limit of ODP.

   You can troubleshoot the issue by using the following methods:

   * Method 1: Check the connection diagnostic logs.

      ```shell
      [2023-09-08 11:19:26.617385] [110562][Y0-00007FE1F06AC4E0] [CONNECTION](trace_type="LOGIN_TRACE", connection_diagnosis={cs_id:1031798805, ss_id:0, proxy_session_id:0, server_session_id:0, client_addr:"127.0.0.1:40004", server_addr:"*Not IP address [0]*:0", cluster_name:"undefined", tenant_name:"sys", user_name:"root", error_code:-5059, error_msg:"Too many sessions", request_cmd:"COM_SLEEP", sql_cmd:"COM_LOGIN"}{internal_sql:""})
      ```

      The fields in the diagnostic information are described as follows:

      * `trace_type`: the diagnostic type, which is `LOGIN_TRACE` in this example, indicating that the disconnection is caused by a logon failure.

      * `error_msg`: the error message, which is `Too many session` in this example, indicating that the logon fails because the number of connections reaches the upper limit.

   * Method 2: Check the error message. The error message `Too many sessions` is returned when you run a connection command.

      ```shell
      $ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2899 -uroot@sys -Dtest -A -c
      ERROR 1203 (42000): Too many sessions
      ```
