# Deployment modes

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).

The deployment mode varies with the real physical environment and business requirements. When you deploy ODP in a production environment, take the following factors into consideration:

* Delivery mode

   ODP is provided in RPM package mode and can be deployed using OceanBase Deployer (OBD), OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), or the CLI.

* Quantity

   The number of ODPs that can be deployed is related with the number of applications or OBServers, depending on the specific deployment mode.

* Deployment modes

   The response time and resource preemption strategies vary with the deployment mode, and the deployment mode significantly affects the performance. ODP supports two deployment modes: deployment on the OBServer side, and independent deployment.

## Deployment on the OBServer side

ODP deployment on the OBServer side means that one ODP process on deployed on one OBServer. In this way, the number of ODPs is the same as that of OBServers. This deployment mode does not involve the correspondence between the numbers of applications and ODPs. You can also deploy one ODP in each zone.

The following figure shows a common ODP deployment mode in Apsara Stack.

## Independent deployment

In independent deployment mode, ODP is deployed on a dedicated server. The number of ODPs is not related to the number of applications or OBServers, but depends on specific business requirements.

We recommend that you use a midrange computer, for example, a 16C 16G ECS instance. In independent deployment mode, resource preemption between the OBServer and ODP will not occur. You can better manage ODP and use ODP as a resource pool to provide external services. Currently, this deployment mode is used in a public cloud.
