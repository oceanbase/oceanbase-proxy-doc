# Deploy ODP by using OCP

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) by using OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). You can also deploy ODP in the following ways:

* Deploy ODP by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD). For more information, see [Deploy ODP by using OBD](50.install-by-obd.md).

* Deploy ODP by using a CLI. For more information, see [Deploy ODP by using a CLI](100.install-odp.md).

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed OCP. For detailed instructions, see [OCP Deployment Guide](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838465).

* The user who has logged in to OCP has the permission to manage hosts and ODP.

* The ODP software package has been uploaded to OCP.

* Netcat has been installed on the server where ODP will be deployed.

   The following table describes the fields that you need to configure.

   | **Field** | **Description** |
   |------------|----------------------|
   | **IP Address** | The IPv4 address of the host to be added.  |
   | **SSH Port** | Default value: `22`.  |
   | **Host Type** | The label assigned to hosts with the same configuration to facilitate host management. If the host type you need is not available, you can click **Create Host Type** in the drop-down list to create a new host type.  |
   | **IDC** | The IDC where the server is deployed. If the IDC you need is not available, you can click **Create IDC** to create a new IDC. The IDC information includes **IDC** and **Region**. <ul><li>**IDC** is a host attribute required for an OceanBase cluster, and this attribute will be used as a reference for OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing strategies. Please fill in according to the actual situation. </li><li>**Region** specifies the geographical location where the host is located. It is also a host attribute required for an OceanBase cluster. This attribute will also be used as a reference for OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing strategies. Please fill in according to the actual situation. </li></ul><blockquote><b>**Note**: </b></br>OCP V3.1.1 and later versions support the multi-zone deployment mode. In this deployment mode, when you add an IDC, it will be created in the zone where the current OCP is located. </blockquote> |
   | **Host Type** | Valid values: **Physical Machine** and **Container**.  |
   | **Credentials** | The credentials used for remotely login to the physical machine. If the credential you need is not available, you can click **Add Credential** from the drop-down list to create a new credential. </br>Note the following when creating a new credential:<ul><li>**Credential Name**: Starts with a letter, ends with a letter or a number, contains letters, numbers, and underscores, and is 2 to 32 characters long. </li><li>**Authorization Type**: Valid values: **Username/Password** and **SSH Private Key**. </li> <li>**User Type**: Supports two types of users: one is an SSH user with root permissions, and the other is an ordinary user with root permissions. For ordinary users with root permissions, they must first be granted the permission for the password-free execution of the sudo command, which means they do not need to enter a password when running the sudo command. Currently, OCP only supports configuring all commands for the password-free execution of sudo, which is achieved by adding `username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` to the `sudoers` file in the `/etc` directory. </li></ul> |
   | **Host Alias (Optional)** | The label assigned to hosts with the same configuration. It is recommended that you specify a meaningful alias to facilitate host management.  |
   | **Description (Optional)** | The host comments, which can be used to facilitate host management.  |

5. Click **OK**.

### Step 2: Create an ODP cluster

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>You can deploy ODP when creating an ODP cluster, or deploy it by adding an ODP to a newly created ODP cluster (see “Step 3: Add an ODP” below).</p>
</main>
  
1. Log in to OCP.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** to go to the OBProxy page.

3. Click **Create OBProxy Cluster** in the upper-right corner to go to the **Create OBProxy Cluster** page.

4. On the **Create OBProxy Cluster** page, specify parameters on the following tabs.

   1. **Basic Settings**

      The following figure shows parameters on the **Basic Settings** tab.

      ![Basic information](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/odp/V4.2.1/en-US/200.install/80.install-by-ocp-03.png)

      The following table describes these parameters.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |--------|------------|
      | **Cluster Name** | You can customize the cluster name based on your actual situation. The name starts with a letter, and contains letters, numbers, and underscores. |
      | **Enter the password of the proxyro user** | The Proxyro user is used by ODP to access the OceanBase cluster. If no password is specified, the default password of the proxyro user will be used for the connection. The password must meet the following requirements:<ul><li>The password length should be between 8 and 32 characters. </li><li>The password can only contain letters, numbers, and special characters `~!@#%^&*_-+=\|(){}[]:;,.?/` </li><li>The password must contain at least two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, two numbers, and two special characters. </li></ul> |
      | **Load balancing management** | After enabling load balancing management, you can configure OBLB to improve the load balancing capability of the ODP cluster. <ul><li>OBLB Service: You can select the OBLB service already configured when deploying OCP, or click **Add OBLB Service** in the drop-down list to add an OBLB service. <!--For more information, see **Add a load balancer** in [Manage load balancing](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-cn-10000000002100859). --></li><ul><li>OBLB Service Address: The OBLB service address. </li><li>OBLB Service Port: The OBLB service port. The default service port is 9090, which can be changed according to the actual situation. </li><li>Username & Password: The OBLB service username and password, which are used to authenticate the calling of the OBLB interface. </li></ul><li>VIP: The virtual IP address of the OBLB service. </li><li>Access Port: The default access port is 2883, which can be changed according to the actual situation. </li><li>Domain Name Configuration (optional): The configuration that points to the VIP and port. The platform does not provide a mapping between VIPs and domain names, so you must prepare the domain name resolution service by yourself. </li></ul> <blockquote>**Note**</br> The **Alibaba Cloud SLB** service applies only to the Apsara Stack environment. It is recommended that you contact Technical Support for assistance. </blockquote> |
      | **Access URL** | The access URL of the ODP cluster. It is only used to generate a connection string for the tenant. You must manually configure load balancing. This parameter is displayed only when **Load balancing management** is disabled. If the access URL is a virtual IP address (VIP), you must manually apply for a VIP and bind it to the ODP server.  |
      | **Access Port Number** | The access port of the ODP cluster. You must enter the actual port based on the VIP. The default value is 2883. This parameter is displayed only when **Load balancing management** is disabled.  |
      | **Startup Method** | The startup method of the ODP cluster. Valid values are as follows:<ul><li>ConfigUrl: The multi-cluster startup method, where the ODP cluster can access multiple OceanBase clusters. </li><li>RsList: The single-cluster startup method. The ODP cluster can only access the OceanBase cluster specified when the ODP cluster is created. After an ODP cluster is created, no more connectable OceanBase clusters can be added. </li></ul> |
      | **Select Accessible OceanBase Clusters** | The OceanBase cluster that the ODP cluster can access. <ul><li>This field is optional when **Startup Method** is **ConfigUrl**. After the cluster is created, you can add more OceanBase clusters by referring to [Add a connectable OceanBase cluster](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838453). </li><li>This field is mandatory when **Startup Method** is **RsList**. Select an OceanBase cluster from the drop-down list. </li><li>If the password box contains the credentials of the proxyro user of the cluster, the proxyro user is selected by default. </li><li>If the password box does not contain the credentials of the proxyro user of the cluster, click **Create Connection** to create the connection credentials for the proxyro user of the cluster. </li> |

   2. **Deploy OBProxy** (optional)

      If you want to deploy ODP when you create an ODP cluster, proceed to this step. Otherwise, you can skip this step; after the cluster is created, you can add an ODP to the cluster by taking over an ODP or adding an ODP. For more information, see [Take over an ODP](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838397) or “Step 3: Add an ODP” below.
